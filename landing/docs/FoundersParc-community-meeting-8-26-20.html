<h1>Founder’s Parc Community Meeting 8/26/20</h1>
<h2>Discussions on the survey questions.</h2>

<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>
    Making Founders Parc a gated community
    Opinions (for and against) could change based on what impact and cost.
    This could increase our HOA costs significantly.
    It will also become a hassle to manage people coming (Guests and deliveries etc).
    What are the advantages for it vs all the costs.
    There are also questions about how gates would even work when there are businesses like ACME and the Animal
    Emergency hospital within the neighborhood. Adding gates would restrict access to these businesses.
</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>
    Builders should pay an HOA fee due to all the debris they cause
    How do we have the authority to do this. Sounds like a good idea but is it possible.
</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>
    Changing lawn mowing schedule
    Depending on the season it makes sense to adjust the schedule. In the summer cutting the lawn every week might be
    needed while not as much through the rest of the year.
    We should be careful not let go of anything without getting something back in exchange.
    For this kind of decision we should make sure that a representative for the community is present to ensure that we
    get something in exchange for changing the schedule.
    Our HOA is not changing even if the costs are so simply changing the schedule will not help us.
</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>
    Installing fake grass and tennis/soccer fields
    The background behind the turf and potential tennis court or soccer fields was that there is plenty of open space
    being underutilized. There is also a cost to maintaining grass in those large areas.
    There are also concerns with this idea because people may not want to have a tennis court or soccer field next to
    their house. Turf is also not as desirable as real grass
    Another thought is that the community doesn’t have any kind of park or playground for kids. Potentially we could use
    some open areas to provide these.
</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>
    Restricting the entrance of large construction trucks to only enter from one side of the community
    Restricting construction worker and construction truck traffic will not change the fact that they still need to
    access the community and will only shift the impact of their presence to other homeowners.
    Construction in Founders Parc should be winding down within the next year and this may not be a battle worth
    investing time and effort into.
</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>
    HOA is not responding to emails and calls. Also not posting account statements.
    Everyone generally agrees that we are not getting what we paid for. We need to get a seat on the board to give the
    community a voice.
    Getting compensation for pool not being build on time
    They sold us on a recreation center to be completed by summer 2019 and it didn’t even start until 2020.
    While Beazers might not be legally liable for a pool being specifically added or not the excuse about Covid19 is
    invalid due to construction being an essential service as well as the apartments being able to complete their pool
    on schedule during the same time period.
    We should definitely address this even though it is not clear what right we have to make such demands.
    There is also money allocated for pool maintenance and other costs.
</p>

<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>
    Upon 75% completion one homeowner should be appointed as a member of the board of directors. Mehboob (Mike) Lakhani
    should represent our community
    We all should get more educated on our HOA. This is zoned as a mixed community so there will be a lot of parties
    with seats on the board.
    We should not blindly appoint anyone.
    The representative should operate on their own personal opinion but the opinion of the community.
    There will also be several different roles that others could fill to support this. It should not be one person
    responsible for everything.
    We should have a rep once 75% of the lots are sold.
    The HOA does respond to emails even if they don’t take action. We should all email them to let them know that we are
    aware of our right to appoint a representative and that we plan to do so as soon as that is an option.
    Several other community members offered their experience to support these responsibilities.
</p>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<p>
    Builders and developer have done a very poor job at installing sprinklers and landscape in common areas.
    Sprinklers were installed very poorly and damage could cost a lot of money. We should look into inspecting the
    common areas for problems the same way we have for our own homes so that we can address these issues and demand
    fixes.
    These concerns are related to the builder/developer and not so much the HOA.
</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>
<p>
    Mike will schedule the next meeting / City petition survey and Mark and Linda will volunteer their time to try to get
    answers on the CC&R.
