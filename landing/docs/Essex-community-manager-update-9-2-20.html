    <h1>Community Update</h1>
    <p>Update from the Essex community manager Michael Morgan</p>

    <h2>Board Seats update</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots are currently at 40% sold</li>
        <li>The percentage is monitored monthly and when it reaches 75%, a meeting will be held at the pool patio most
            likely to discuss the community takeover of the HOA and starting with nominating the first board member.
        </li>
        <li>If multiple people are interested in becoming the representative, an election will be held with those that
            attend the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>Once all lots are sold, we will fully take over the board with up to 5 homeowner board members who are
            elected. I would estimate we are still 1.5 - 2 years away from the full take over happening.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h2>Update on the petition items</h2>
    <p>I brought up a few items we had on the petitions just to get an idea of how these ideas would be considered. Any
        major aesthetic changes to the neighborhood will basically be left on the table until we fully take over the
        board. The builders and developers want to sell the homes in a community that the builders feel best serves the
        goal of getting the community properties sold. So basically, a weird looking artificial turf field is not going
        to sell houses and they won't consider that. But with any idea we have, once the takeover happens, we would be
        able to hash that out as a community.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Concerning the pool delays</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The pool is delayed due to the State of Texas putting a halt on all pool permits. They cannot open the
            building
            until the permits are granted.
        </li>
        <li>The gym equipment and pool furniture have been received and are in storage right now in the amenity
            center.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h2>Update on gating the community</h2>
    <p>I also talked about the possibility of becoming a gated community. Michael states while you do have the pros of
        less traffic through the neighborhood, we would have to now incur costs of taking care of the roads and
        streetlights.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A minimum $100,000 upfront cost would be incurred to install gates and go through all the city permitting
            and studies which would have to be performed by the Public Safety Director of Euless.
        </li>
        <li>A significant and permanent increase to our fees should be expected to maintain the gates and roads.</li>
        <li>As long as the builders are selling lots, my take is gating the community will probably not be considered
            during this time.
        </li>
    </ul>
